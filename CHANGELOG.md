# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Long titles no longer cut an emoji or an accented letter in half, and
  Korean, Japanese and Chinese characters count double toward the title
  length, so wide titles take the room the setting promises. The placeholder
  letter keeps a whole emoji or syllable too (#17, @seunghan91)

## 1.2.0

- Agent status for omp (oh-my-pi): add `hooks/omp-extension.js` to your omp
  config and its terminals get the same badges as Claude Code. An approval
  prompt waits 1.5s before showing `!`, so a quick answer never flashes
  (#14, @a-lang)
- A "Pill background" setting under Appearance hides the faint fill behind
  occupied and hovered workspaces. The active workspace keeps its highlight
  (#1, @tseluka)
- A workspace that shows a single icon no longer highlights it as focused
  (#12, #13, @tseluka)
- Sharper app icons, and an app with no icon shows the first letter of its own
  name instead of a shared prefix, so `org.omarchy.herdr` reads "H", not "O"
  (#10, @Natetgmaxwell)
- Security: window titles in the bar and in previews render as plain text, so
  a title with markup can no longer load remote images in the shell

## 1.1.0

- Settings are organised into six pages: App icons, Windows, Appearance,
  Workspaces, Previews, and Behaviour. They work from the keyboard, the
  focused title length can be set, and resetting asks first (#8, @tcballard)
- The settings gear is off by default. Right-click the widget to open
  settings, or turn the gear on under Appearance; it now sits in a fixed slot
  before the workspaces (#8)
- Agent status for OpenCode: link `hooks/opencode-plugin.js` into OpenCode and
  its terminals get the same badges as Claude Code. A permission prompt waits
  1.5s before showing `!`, so `--auto` never flashes (#4, @FarzadHayat)
- Agent status: a `working` or `waiting` badge left behind by a crashed agent
  clears within a minute (#3, @FarzadHayat)
- Previews fit portrait and rotated monitors (#6, @VulpesZerda27)
- Fixed: changing the animation speed, or turning animations off and on, hid
  every workspace pill until the shell restarted (#9, reported by @movshuri,
  fix by @Coding-Sparrow)

## 1.0.0

First stable release, ready for the Omarchy plugin marketplace.

- The plugin ID is now `tornikegomareli.spaces`, matching the repository owner.
  If you installed an earlier version, remove `insanearts.spaces`, add the plugin
  again, and update the hook paths in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- README: screenshots from the product film, requirements, and update and
  removal instructions
- Marketplace preview image
- Verified with the bar on the top, bottom, left and right edges

## 0.3.0

- Agent status: terminals running Claude Code show a spinner while the agent
  works, a pulsing `!` when it needs input, and a check mark when it is done.
  Workspaces with a waiting agent pulse
- `hooks/claude-hook` reports agent state; see the README for setup
- Setting to turn agent status off

## 0.2.0

- Live workspace previews: hover another workspace to see a miniature of it,
  with each window where it really is. Click a window to jump to it
- The preview slides between workspaces as you move along the bar
- Hovering an app icon highlights its window in the preview
- `peek` command to open a preview from a keybinding:
  `omarchy-shell insanearts.spaces peek 3`
- Settings: turn previews on or off, preview size, live video or still frame
- Icons for apps with reverse-DNS ids, such as `dev.example.tool`
- Fix: workspaces could stay half faded after appearing

## 0.1.0

First release.

- Workspace pills that show the icons of the apps open on each workspace
- The active workspace slides open; the focused window is highlighted
- Click a workspace or an icon to focus it; scroll to switch workspaces
- Settings panel: when icons show, icon style and size, grouping by app,
  active style, labels, density, urgent highlights, tooltips, animations
- Icons for Chromium web apps and apps missing from the icon theme
